# Personal Web — Tomáš Klepač

Portfolio microsite for a web developer from Plzeň. Built as a fast, static front end with a highlighted case study for Re-Move Harmony (massage and movement therapy clinic).

## What’s inside
- Responsive one-page layout with sections: About, Services, Pricing, Workflow, Portfolio, Contact.
- Featured project card for Re-Move Harmony with hero imagery, tags, and CTA.
- Smooth scrolling, fade-in reveals, and accessible mobile nav (hamburger toggle with ARIA states).
- Lightweight stack: vanilla HTML, CSS, and a small JS helper.

## Structure
- `index.html` — page markup and content.
- `css/style.css` — theming, layout, animations.
- `js/main.js` — nav toggle/accessibility glue.
- `assets/` — images and icons.
